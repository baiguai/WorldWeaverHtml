WorldWeaver (WW) is an Interactive Fiction (IF) engine that was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It is made up of three stand alone HTML files:

* **worldweaver.html**<br />This file plays the games you've built. Make a copy of the core worldweaver.html file for each game you want to build. You can rename it to your game's name.
* **builder.html**<br />This file is used to define WW games using a graphical interface. Make a copy of the core builder.html file for each game you want to build.
* **importer.html**<br />This file allows you to define your games using Norman script.

It also ships with an exhaustive help system for people who wish to build games in WW. This is the **ww_help.html** file.
Refer to this help system for in-depth information on WW.
