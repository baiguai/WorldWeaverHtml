# WorldWeaver
WorldWeaver is an Interactive Fiction (IF) Engine AND IF game player written as stand alone HTML files. There are three HTML files that comprise this IF engine and game player:

* builder.html
    * The builder.html file is a graphical interface used to build WW games. It is not as powerful as building games in script, but is suitable for those who are new to WW.

* importer.html
    * The importer.html file goes through every .nrmn file within the specified directory and imports those script files into a database object that can be saved within the game playing .html file.

* worldweaver.html
    * This is the game playing file. It should be renamed to your particular game's name, similar to: **dark_dungeon.html**
